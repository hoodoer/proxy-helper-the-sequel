# ProxyHelper2

Proxy Helper is a WiFi Pineapple module that will automatically configure the Pineapple for IP forwarding and set up the necessary rules. This allows the user to easily forward web traffic to a proxy such as Burp Suite for inspection.

This is a re-implementation of https://github.com/trustedsec/proxy_helper to work on newer hak5 pineapples. 

iptable backups are stored in:
/pineapple/iptablesBackups
