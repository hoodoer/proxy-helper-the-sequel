# ProxyHelper2

Note, you can install this right in the Pineapple UI interface now in the online Module "store".


Proxy Helper is a WiFi Pineapple module that will automatically configure the Pineapple for IP forwarding and set up the necessary rules. This allows the user to easily forward web traffic to a proxy such as Burp Suite for inspection.

This is a re-implementation of https://github.com/trustedsec/proxy_helper to work on newer hak5 pineapples. 

iptable backups are stored in:
/pineapple/iptablesBackups


## Install
Download the module:<br>
[ProxyHelper2.tar.bz2](https://github.com/hoodoer/proxy-helper-the-sequel/releases/download/v1.0/ProxyHelper2.tar.bz2) <br>
And uncompress on your pineapple in /pineapple/modules
